# WDI Documentation

### Wikipedia type app that allows people to add their own definitions to methods and coding devices.

### Development process

Technologies used: Ruby on Rails  

Gems: Bootstrap, Bcrypt, Postgresql

## description

This app allows people to create and add to definitions of methods and other aspects of the class. This is similar to Wikipedia and anyone is able to read the documentation that is written.

## User Stories

As a user, I am presented with a landing page which has a brief description of the app and then a list of methods that you can click on and a search bar which does not work at the time this readme was written. I am able to click on the methods to see what they do and if I wish to add to them, I must login in. Once I log in, there is a page that lays out the types of methods that I have created.


## Future implementations

The search bar is a key component that is not yet working. This is number one. Other elements that I would like to include are a favorites section, a recently added bar to the home page, the ability to upload images, and also styling throughout the app.
